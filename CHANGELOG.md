# Changelog

All notable changes to the templates in this repository are documented here, per template. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## basic

### [1.13.1] - 2026-10-08

#### Removed

- The stray `.cookiecutter-template-version` file, re-added by 1.12.0 and stale
  since. Template lineage is tracked by `.cruft.json` (see root `CLAUDE.md`);
  `cruft update` deletes the file from downstream projects.

### [1.13.0] - 2026-10-07

#### Added

- `.claude/skills/issue-decomposition/` ships in every generated project. The
  Sequence stage of the coding workflow (`_workflow/`) runs after Bootstrap, so
  the skill must already be in the repo. It checks the spec is approved, avoids
  duplicating existing issues, proposes the issue list with a Done-criteria
  coverage table for approval, then opens issues from the `feature_request`
  template. It lives only here (moved out of `_workflow/skills/`), so there is
  one copy.

#### Removed

- The `coding_factory` prompt and everything it gated: the `scrum-master.yml` and
  `approve.yml` launcher workflows, the README "Coding-factory launchers"
  section, the `CLAUDE.md` Profile line, and the `github-actions.md` Governance
  note. They implemented the retired Managed-Agent design (Scrum Master,
  Planner, Build subagents). Projects that had `coding_factory=yes` will see
  `cruft update` delete those files; remove the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and
  `GITHUB_MCP_TOKEN` secrets if nothing else uses them.

#### Fixed

- A generated project's first CI run failed in `Lint & Format`: Ruff 0.16+ also
  checks Python code blocks inside Markdown, and the template's own
  `.claude/rules/pytest-rules.md` and `.claude/standards/configuration.md` are not
  Ruff-formatted. `pyproject.toml` now sets `extend-exclude = ["*.md"]`, so
  `ruff format --check .` in CI checks Python files only — the same set the local
  pre-commit hook (`types: [python]`) already checked, so the two gates agree.

### [1.12.0] - 2026-09-28

#### Added

- A `diagrams` (`no`/`yes`, default `no`) cookiecutter prompt that gates the
  inclusion of architecture diagramming standards and tooling. When `yes`, the
  template renders `.claude/standards/diagramming.md` and documents the
  `Diagramming` line in `CLAUDE.md`'s `## Profile`. Generated projects can use
  the `diagrams` library to document system architecture as code — diagrams are
  generated from Python, versionable in git, reviewable, and kept in sync with
  the infrastructure. When `no`, the diagramming standard is not documented and
  projects omit the feature.
- `diagramming.md` standard under `.claude/standards/` that explains when to use
  diagrams (system topology, network boundaries, entry/exit points, data flow),
  when not to (implementation details, trivial systems, sequences), the principle
  of one diagram per abstraction layer (infrastructure/orchestration/application),
  and the structure for diagram scripts outside `src/` under `docs/architecture/`
  paired with markdown companion documentation.

### [1.11.0] - 2026-08-01

#### Added

- A `coding_factory` (`no`/`yes`, default `no`) cookiecutter prompt that gates
  two thin **Scrum Master launcher** GitHub Actions. When `yes`, the template
  renders `.github/workflows/scrum-master.yml` and `.github/workflows/approve.yml`;
  when `no`, neither file is created. Gating uses the empty-filename technique
  (each source file is named `{% if cookiecutter.coding_factory == 'yes' %}<name>.yml{% endif %}`,
  which cookiecutter/cruft skip when the name renders empty) — deliberately **not**
  a post-generation hook, which the template no longer has (see 1.10.0) and which
  would break `cruft update`.
- The two launchers implement the coding-factory design (`_workflow/`): each does
  no build work — it only launches the resumable **Scrum Master** orchestrator (a
  Claude Managed Agent) and exits. `scrum-master.yml` fires on every push to `main`
  (single-flight via a `scrum-master` concurrency group with `cancel-in-progress`;
  also `workflow_dispatch` for a manual re-reconcile); `approve.yml` fires on an
  `issue_comment` guarded to a top-level `/approve` PR comment from an authorized
  commenter (`OWNER`/`MEMBER`/`COLLABORATOR`) and launches the Scrum Master (which
  spawns Build) — it never merges. Both follow the repo's Actions conventions:
  least-privilege `permissions: contents: read`, `timeout-minutes`, secrets and
  event context passed via `env:` (never interpolated into `run:`), and every
  `${{ ... }}` expression `{% raw %}`-wrapped for the Jinja render. The actual
  managed-agents API launch call is stubbed (a loud `::error::` until wired), to be
  finalized once the API surface is pinned.
- Required-secrets documentation (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_MCP_TOKEN`) in a
  conditional `README.md` section, a `coding_factory` line in `CLAUDE.md`'s
  `## Profile`, and a Governance note in `.claude/rules/github-actions.md` marking
  both launchers as event launchers that must never be wired into `ci.yml` or added
  to branch protection (same posture as `template-sync.yml`). All three render only
  under `coding_factory=yes`.

### [1.10.0] - 2026-08-01

#### Added

- Adopted [`cruft`](https://cruft.github.io/cruft/) as the template→project sync
  mechanism. Generating with `cruft create … --directory basic` (now the
  recommended path, documented in the root `CLAUDE.md`) writes a `.cruft.json` into
  the project recording the template URL, the exact template commit, and the
  answered context — so a project can later pull in template improvements via a
  3-way merge instead of going stale.
- `template-sync.yml`, an **on-demand** reusable workflow (`workflow_dispatch` +
  `workflow_call`, deliberately *not* in the `ci.yml` gate chain and *not*
  scheduled) that runs `uvx cruft check` and reports whether the project is behind
  its template. Missing `.cruft.json` (a pre-cruft project) → green with a retrofit
  notice, never a hard fail. Documented as intentionally-advisory in
  `.claude/rules/github-actions.md` (Governance) so it is never added to branch
  protection.
- Two agent skills: `.claude/skills/update-from-template/` (check → `cruft update`
  → resolve `.rej` → run the full gate → summarize the `CHANGELOG.md` delta) and
  `.claude/skills/link-to-template/` (retrofit a project that predates cruft by
  deriving its baseline tag, running `cruft link`, then handing off to
  `update-from-template`). `link-to-template` is also kept at the source-repo root
  so it can be run against external pre-cruft projects; the two copies are
  byte-identical. Both skills manage a `.cruft.json` `skip` list
  (`.git`/`.venv`/`uv.lock`) so cruft never diffs or patches generated artifacts —
  essential when retrofitting a project generated by an older template version,
  whose baseline carries generation-time `.git`/`.venv` artifacts.
  `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` gained a template-sync section, and
  `Bash(uvx cruft *)`/`Bash(cruft *)` were added to the `.claude/settings.json`
  allowlist.
- The template repo is now tagged per version (`basic-v<semver>`), with all
  historical versions (`basic-v1.0.0` … `basic-v1.9.0`) backfilled. Tagging is
  folded into the release/bump ritual in the root `CLAUDE.md`; the pushed tag is
  the authoritative version marker and the ref the retrofit path pins to.
- A `Makefile` with a `setup` target (`uv sync` + `pre-commit install` for both
  hook stages) plus `test`/`lint`/`format`/`typecheck`/`check`/`template-check`
  shortcuts. `make setup` is the one-time onboarding step after cloning — Git can't
  auto-install hooks on clone, so a bootstrap command is unavoidable, and CI stays
  the real gate regardless. `Bash(make *)` added to the `.claude/settings.json`
  allowlist.

#### Removed

- The cookiecutter post-generation hook (`hooks/post_gen_project.py`, and the now
  empty `hooks/` directory). It previously ran `git init` and auto-installed the
  pre-commit/pre-push hooks, but cruft re-runs a template's post-gen hook inside its
  own internal renders when computing an update — and anything the hook writes to
  the tree (`git init` → a `.git/`; `pre-commit install` → machine-specific paths in
  `.git/hooks/`; `uv run`/`uv sync` → a `.venv/`) becomes state cruft must reconcile,
  and `git apply` refuses paths under `.git/`, which made cruft **silently drop real
  template changes**. Generation now has no side effects; onboarding is the generated
  project's own `make setup` (see Added), and the target is assumed to already be a
  Git repository.
- `.cookiecutter-template-version` — retired in favour of `.cruft.json` (authoritative
  for a generated project's lineage) plus the `basic-v*` git tags (the template's own
  version record). New projects no longer carry the file; the `link-to-template` skill
  removes it from a pre-cruft project as part of retrofitting `.cruft.json`.

### [1.9.0] - 2026-08-01

#### Added

- A self-detecting `integration-tests.yml` reusable workflow, wired into
  `ci.yml` as an `Integration Tests` job that `needs: [unit-tests]` (so it only
  runs once the unit gate is green — no point standing up Docker services behind
  a red unit suite). The workflow can never go green without having run the
  integration tests that exist, via three behaviours: no `integration`-marked
  tests present → green, services never started; tests present but no
  `docker-compose.yml`/`compose.yaml` → hard fail with a loud `::error::`, never
  a silent skip; tests present with a compose file → `docker compose up -d
  --wait`, run `pytest -m integration`, then always `docker compose down -v`.
  Detection keys on pytest's collection exit code (5 = nothing collected →
  nothing to run; a collection error is treated as "tests exist" so the real
  run surfaces it). No compose file or example integration test is shipped — the
  workflow is the enforcement mechanism; a project provisions its own services
  when it adds integration tests.

#### Changed

- `unit-tests.yml` now runs `pytest -m "not integration"` so integration tests
  run only in the dedicated stage (with their services) instead of double-running
  unserviced in the unit stage; also fixed a `--cov=src\` line-continuation quirk
  in that command (the missing space joined it to the next flag).
- `github-actions.md` (Governance) now lists `Integration Tests` among the
  required status-check names; `testing.md` documents the two-stage CI split and
  the "adding an integration test requires committing a compose file" rule.

### [1.8.0] - 2026-07-29

#### Added

- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and a `hooks/post_gen_project.py` post-generation
  hook that bake local Git hooks into every generated project via the
  [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) framework. The `pre-commit` stage
  runs `ruff format --check`, `ruff check`, `mypy src`, and — when
  `security == "yes"` — `bandit -r src`; the `pre-push` stage runs `pytest`.
  This mirrors the checks in `ci.yml` (`format-lint.yml`, `type-check.yml`,
  `unit-tests.yml`) so failures surface at commit/push time instead of only
  in CI. Hooks are `repo: local` and call `uv run`, so their versions track
  the pinned dev-dependency versions (single source of truth) rather than a
  second, drifting toolchain.
- `post_gen_project.py` runs `git init` (if the target isn't already a repo)
  and installs both hook types at generation time, degrading gracefully —
  printing manual `uv run pre-commit install` instructions and exiting 0 —
  if `git`/`pre-commit` isn't available on the generating machine.
- `pre-commit` added to the `dev` dependency group in `pyproject.toml`;
  `uv run pre-commit`, `uv run bandit`, and `git commit`/`git push` added to
  the `.claude/settings.json` allowlist (the last two so the hook-gated commit
  workflow doesn't prompt). `security.md` reconciled so its "run `bandit` in
  pre-commit" guidance now reflects the real, installed hook.

### [1.7.0] - 2026-07-29

#### Added

- `.claude/standards/database.md`, a new unconditional standard establishing the
  house database policy: schema changes go through checked-in, versioned
  **migrations** (never an ad-hoc hand-run `ALTER`), and those migrations are
  **forward-only** — no down/downgrade migrations; a bad migration is undone by
  writing a *new* forward migration that corrects it. The rationale is
  production discipline: a live schema is never downgraded, so dev and CI
  exercise the same one-way path prod does. The standard also names a preferred
  (but not exclusive) stack — **PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy + Alembic** — with
  Alembic-specific guidance to leave `downgrade()` a no-op. Imported into
  `CLAUDE.md` for every project (there is no cookiecutter database toggle; the
  guidance is harmless on projects without a database).

### [1.6.0] - 2026-07-29

#### Added

- Two new sections in the scaffolded `feature_request` issue template
  (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`): **Acceptance criteria** (with a
  starter `- [ ]` checkbox) and **Out of scope**. This lets the Software Factory
  decomposition/plan workflow read acceptance criteria straight from each issue
  instead of bolting one on ad hoc. `bug_report.md` and the front matter
  (`feat:` title prefix, `enhancement` label) are unchanged.

### [1.5.0] - 2026-07-29

#### Added

- `.claude/standards/decisions.md`, a new unconditional standard that defines
  *when* an architecture decision earns an ADR (significant or hard-to-reverse
  choices — storage/framework, module boundaries, subsystem-wide dependencies —
  judged on reversibility and blast radius, not size) and points at the `adr`
  skill for the mechanics. The standard carries only the trigger policy; the
  skill (assumed available in the environment) owns the format, numbering, and
  file location, with a `docs/adr/NNNN-*.md` Markdown fallback if the skill is
  absent. Imported into `CLAUDE.md` for every project.

### [1.4.0] - 2026-07-12

#### Added

- `.claude/standards/wiki.md`, a new unconditional standard describing the
  `openwiki/` codebase wiki: it is generated output that is never hand-edited,
  and must be regenerated (`openwiki code --update`) and committed alongside
  the code change that prompted it. Imported into `CLAUDE.md` for every
  project.
- A `## Wiki` section in `README.md` documenting the per-machine `openwiki`
  install (`npm install -g openwiki`), one-time auth, and the
  `openwiki code --init`/`--update` regenerate commands — `openwiki` is a
  global CLI, never a project dependency.
- `openwiki` entries (`Bash(openwiki)`, `Bash(openwiki *)`,
  `Bash(npm install -g openwiki)`) in the `.claude/settings.json` whitelist so
  agents may regenerate the wiki without an approval prompt.

#### Changed

- `CLAUDE.md`'s `## Imports` section now renders each `@`-import as a Markdown
  list item (`- @...`) instead of a bare line, so it displays as a proper list
  while still resolving as a Claude Code import.

### [1.3.0] - 2026-07-12

#### Added

- A `## Profile` section in `CLAUDE.md` listing whether each of app-config,
  structured-logging, telemetry, and security is enabled for the project, so
  an agent can read the active cross-cutting concerns directly instead of
  inspecting `cookiecutter.json` or `pyproject.toml`.

#### Changed

- `CLAUDE.md`'s `## Imports` section now conditionally imports
  `configuration.md` (`app_config`), `telemetry.md` (`telemetry`), and
  `security.md` (`security`) based on the matching toggle, matching the
  conditional dependencies already in `pyproject.toml`. `git-workflow.md`,
  `testing.md`, `error-handling.md`, and `logging.md` import unconditionally
  — the last of these because `logging.md` itself already gates its
  `structlog`-vs-stdlib guidance on `structured_logging`. This closes out
  the wiring flagged as a follow-up in the 1.2.0 entry below.

### [1.2.0] - 2026-07-12

#### Added

- Full content for the six `.claude/standards/` documents stubbed in 1.1.0
  (`configuration.md`, `logging.md`, `telemetry.md`, `error-handling.md`,
  `security.md`, `testing.md`), each prescribing patterns and approved
  Python libraries for its concern (`pydantic-settings`, `structlog`,
  OpenTelemetry, `bandit`, `pytest-mock`). `configuration.md` covers nested
  per-concern `BaseSettings` sub-sections (with a `__`-delimited env var
  naming convention), JSON config files as an additional settings source,
  and centralizing non-secret defaults in a single dict for easy test
  overrides. `logging.md` treats `structlog` as required only when
  `structured_logging` is enabled, with `logging` module as the fallback.
- `pytest-mock` added to the `dev` dependency group (unconditional — the
  testing standard applies regardless of profile).
- `tests/conftest.py` with a `pytest_configure` hook that turns on live
  `INFO`-level log output automatically when running `pytest -v`.

#### Changed

- `.claude/standards/` documents are no longer wired to a `CLAUDE.md`
  section that doesn't exist yet (the earlier stub-era draft referenced
  scaffold-time profile checks in `CLAUDE.md`; that wiring is still a
  follow-up, not yet in this template).

### [1.1.0] - 2026-07-12

#### Added

- `app_config`, `structured_logging`, `telemetry`, and `security` (`no`/`yes`) cookiecutter prompts; `pyproject.toml` now conditionally includes `pydantic-settings`/`python-dotenv` (app_config), `structlog` (structured_logging), `opentelemetry-sdk`/`opentelemetry-api` (telemetry), and `bandit` (security) based on the selections — each prompt is independent, with no forced bundling.
- `.claude/standards/` directory alongside `.claude/rules/` for cross-cutting, non-file-type-specific agent guidance — stubbed with `configuration.md`, `logging.md`, `telemetry.md`, `error-handling.md`, `security.md`, `testing.md` (full content is a follow-up issue).

#### Changed

- Moved `docs/GITWORKFLOW.md` to `.claude/standards/git-workflow.md` and updated `CLAUDE.md`'s `@` import path accordingly.

#### Removed

- The `docs/` folder (empty after the `GITWORKFLOW.md` move) and the now-dead `docs/**` entry in `ci.yml`'s `paths-ignore`.

### [1.0.0] - 2026-07-07

#### Added

- Initial `basic` template: minimal Python project (`src/` + `tests/`) using `uv`.
- CI pipeline (`ci.yml`) composed of reusable `format-lint.yml`, `type-check.yml`, `unit-tests.yml` workflows, with pinned action SHAs, `timeout-minutes`, and PR concurrency cancellation.
- `.github/dependabot.yml` to keep pinned GitHub Actions SHAs updated.
- Modular git workflow docs (`docs/GITWORKFLOW.md`) imported into `CLAUDE.md` via Claude Code's `@` import syntax.
- `.cookiecutter-template-version` to track which template version a generated project was scaffolded from.
